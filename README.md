# ForzaLavoro
This is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) project that I used to explore a dataset about the Italian work force.

I was curious to satisfy some curiosity I had about the composition the Italian work force, here some:

- nationality composition;
- gender;
- education qualification
- contract type;

The result are some chart that you can find in the [images](./images/) directory.

## The dataset
I downloaded the data from the [Istat](https://www.istat.it/it/), main Italian statistic institute.

You wont find the dataset in this repository because I do not own it but you can freely download the data files in various format (my program uses the tab separated file format) from the Istat site (a registration is required).
